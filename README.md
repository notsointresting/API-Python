---
## Objectives

After completing this lab you will be able to:

*   Load and use RandomUser API, using `RandomUser()` Python library
*   Load and use Fruityvice API, using `requests` Python library
*   Load and use Open-Joke-API, using `requests` Python library

The advantages of using APIs:
 *   **Automation**. Less human effort is required and workflows can be easily updated to become faster and more      
     productive.
 *   **Efficiency**. It allows to use the capabilities of one of the already developed APIs than to try to 
     independently implement some functionality from scratch.
 
The disadvantage of using APIs:
 *   **Security**. If the API is poorly integrated, it means it will be vulnerable to attacks, resulting in data breeches or losses having financial or reputation implications.
